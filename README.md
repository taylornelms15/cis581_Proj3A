Team members: Taylor Nelms, Nikhil Shenoy

## Additional Packages
This project uses FLANN to perform the approximate nearest neighbor matching required in ``feat_match``

## To Do:
- [ ] Figure out how to vectorize ANMS
- [ ] Bi-directional consistency check for feature matching?
- [ ] Optionally implement SIFT feature detectors for ``feat_desc``
